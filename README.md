# Smart_Traffic_Light_Management_AbuDhabi
A reinforcement learning (RL)-based traffic signal control framework that can learn and adapt dynamically to changing traffic conditions autonomously. Through simulation, we aim to demonstrate how RL agents evolve policies that optimize multi-objective performance metrics, balancing competing factors such as traffic flow and delay.
